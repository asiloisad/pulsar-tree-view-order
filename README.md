In computing, natural sort order (or natural sorting) is the ordering of strings in alphabetical order, except that multi-digit numbers are treated atomically, i.e., as if they were a single character. Natural sort order has been promoted as being more human-friendly ("natural") than machine-oriented, pure alphabetical sort order. Natural sort order is not a match of Windows Explorer sort order.

A package reorder directory and files to match natural sort order. A config `tree-view.sortFoldersBeforeFiles` is considered.
